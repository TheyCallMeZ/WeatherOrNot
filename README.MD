## Weather or not 

This project came out of boredom and a conversation with friends about weather apis going to paid subscription models or shutting down for one reason or another. 
Further talking points came about from Where do they get their data anyway? It's doubtful every service has their own weather station that they maintain and privately use.

In walks the National Weather Service from good ol' Weather.gov! 

This was a sample project to show parsing xml and returning as more api friendly json. I take no responsibility for what you do with this code.
